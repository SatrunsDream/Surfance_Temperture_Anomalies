# Surfance Temperture Anomalies
This project explores how visual design choices can shape public perception of climate data, and blurs the line between persuasion and deception. As part of a visualization ethics assignment, I selected the IMF Climate Change Indicators dataset, focusing on global surface temperature anomalies from 1961–2024.

Each visualization intentionally uses different rhetorical framing and design techniques—from color scales and baselines to map projections and language—to influence viewer interpretation. This illustrates how even accurate data can tell different stories depending on how it’s presented.
